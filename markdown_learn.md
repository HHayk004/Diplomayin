# 📝 Learning Markdown

## 📘 Purpose

The purpose of this document is to record my experience learning **Markdown**, understand its **syntax**, explore its **use cases**, and apply it to real-world examples such as project documentation, notes, and technical writing.

By the end of this learning process, I wanted to:

* Understand **what Markdown is** and **why it’s used**.
* Learn the **core syntax** for writing formatted text.
* Gain confidence writing clean and readable documentation.
* Apply Markdown to GitHub projects and personal notes.

## 📚 What Is Markdown?

**Markdown** is a lightweight markup language designed to make text formatting easy to write and read.
It allows you to add structure (headings, lists, links, etc.) to plain text without complex HTML tags.

It was created by *John Gruber* with the goal of being simple and intuitive — you should be able to read the Markdown file even without rendering it.

Common uses of Markdown include:

* `README.md` files for GitHub projects
* Wiki pages and documentation
* Blog posts written in static site generators (like Jekyll or Hugo)
* Notes, changelogs, and task tracking

## 🔍 How I Studied Markdown

To learn Markdown effectively, I followed several steps:

1. **Read official documentation**

   * [Daring Fireball Markdown Guide](https://daringfireball.net/projects/markdown/) — the original specification.
   * [GitHub Flavored Markdown (GFM)](https://github.github.com/gfm/) — extended syntax supported by GitHub.

2. **Explored tutorials and cheat sheets**

   * [Mastering Markdown (GitHub Guide)](https://guides.github.com/features/mastering-markdown/)
   * [Markdown Guide](https://www.markdownguide.org/basic-syntax/)

3. **Practiced writing Markdown**
   I experimented by writing sample `.md` files, using:

   * VS Code’s Markdown Preview (`Ctrl+Shift+V`)
   * Online editors like StackEdit or Dillinger
   * GitHub’s built-in README preview

4. **Compared Markdown and HTML**
   I learned how Markdown simplifies tasks like writing headings or links without requiring full HTML tags.

## 🚀 Next Steps

I plan to:

* Learn **GitHub Flavored Markdown** extensions (tables, mentions, code diff syntax).
* Use Markdown with **static site generators** like Jekyll or MkDocs.
* Explore **documentation automation tools** that use Markdown as input.
